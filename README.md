React mainly depends on two packages React and ReactDOM

### a) React
The react package contains helpers related to create and define elements, component classes and lifecycle hooks, etc. i.e. the guts of a React application.

1. Component
2. PureComponent
3. createElement
4. createRef
5. children
6. version

### b) ReactDOM
ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM which provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting with ReactDOM.render().

1. render
2. unmountComponentAtNode
3. findDOMNode
4. renderToString
